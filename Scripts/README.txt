These scripts require the iData and iFunc classes to be used. 
They provide:

- higher level import routines, which are used when drag-n-droping files into the Matlab
command window
- advanced models for modelling materials (phonons, structure factors, ...)
- advanced data treatment for e.g neutron scattering
