Purpose
-------

  This library aims at providing basic functionality to achieve some of the 
  general tasks needed for scientific data analysis:
    Load, Plot, Save, Fit, Math operations, define and use Models
    
  It also includes specific 'applications' for neutron scattering:
  * instrument simulation and optimisation using McStas <http://www.mcstas.org>
  * neutron scattering triple-axis spectrometer (TAS) resolution calculation 'ResLibCal' <http://ifit.mccode.org/Applications/ResLibCal/doc/ResLibCal.html>
  * neutron scattering time-of-flight spectroscopy S(q,w) analysis. See <http://ifit.mccode.org/Treatment.html>
  * lattice dynamics 4D S(q,w) computation using ASE and DFT codes, which can be coupled to ResLibCal. See <http://ifit.mccode.org/Models.html#mozTocId990577>

Requirements
------------

**Requirements for standalone (binary) package: NONE**
  Stand-alone versions do not require a Matlab license, and have no dependency
  except the Matlab Compiler Runtime (MCR). This latter is included in some of the 
  packages (Mac OSX), or has to be installed separately (Windows, Linux).
  You can get the MCR installer at 
    http://ifit.mccode.org/Downloads/binary
    
  Under MacOSX, you may need to install Java 6. Get it at:
    http://ifit.mccode.org/Downloads/binary/mac64/javaforosx.dmg

**Requirements for Source package**
  Matlab (any version from 7.x, R2007a), possibly a C compiler for the looktxt  
  and the cbf_uncompress MeX.

Installation
------------

**Installation from Source package**
  Copy the library directories where-ever you want or in MALTAB/toolbox/local:
    /home/joe/Matlab/iFit
  or
    /opt/MATLAB/R2010a/toolbox/local/iFit
  
  Then start Matlab and type in, e.g.:
```matlab
>> addpath(genpath('/home/joe/Matlab/iFit'))
```
  or
```matlab
>> addpath(genpath('/opt/MATLAB/R2010a/toolbox/local/iFit'))
```

**Installation for standalone (binary) package**
  Install the MCR (see above, prefer /opt/MATLAB location on Linux systems), then 
  extract the iFit binary package and launch 'ifit'.
  
**MacOSX**
  Drag and drop the iFit icon into your Applications folder. 
  To open the standalone App the first time, use Ctrl-Click on the icon. 
  
  If you get an error dialogue stating you need Java 6, install it from:
    http://ifit.mccode.org/Downloads/binary/mac64/javaforosx.dmg

**Quick start**
  type at Matlab prompt:
```matlab
>> addpath(genpath('/path/to/iFit'))
>> doc(iData)
```
  Then refer to the Quick Start tutorial (in iFit/Docs/QuickStart.html).
  
  The miFit interface will be automaticaly opened. It allows to drag-and-drop 
  data files, plot them, do basic data treatment, fitting, export, ...

Disclaimer
----------
  This is not a professional tool, and there is no Dev team to actively take care
  of it. Expect occasional failures and bugs. However, I try my best to make the 
  software efficient and reliable.
