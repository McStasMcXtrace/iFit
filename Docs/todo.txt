* Hight Priority:
  iData/fits: constraints and so on...
  iFit/iview: check base workspace for ID that match instance objects, and get newest ModificationDate. Then update objects.
  iFit/iview: rename Title, Variable (ID)
  iFit/iview: export variable to base workspace 
              (may be done automatically when not in RunTime mode)
              or drag'n drop on root window
  iFit/iview: search, and optionally select
  iFit/iview: sort by selected state (showing all selected objects).
  iFit/iview: cut/copy/paste

* Low Priority:
  diff
  quad
  norm, var, cov, corrcoef
  fft
  conv (conv2, convn)
  filter, filter2, smooth3
  deconv
  del2
  quiver, quiver2 with gradient
  
  plot 2D: add possibility to select X or Y cuts from pointer/data tip position on surface, plus handling of arrows to move cursor onto the surface (top view). Will be slice(2D)

* Problems:
  setalias(a,'x','y(1:10)') i.e. having a subsref expression within an alias does not work
  define aliases first as simple as possible, then link axes to aliases
