** Purpose:
This small library aims at providing basic functionality to achieve some of the general tasks needed for scienfic data analysis:
    Load, Plot, Save, Fit, Math operations

** License:
Basically this is open-source. Use it if you find it usefull, and enrich it.
If you do produce new methods, please send them back to me so that they are 
added in the software and thus benefit to the community.
I prevent any commercial use of this library.

Disclaimer:
This is not a professional tool, and there is no Dev team to actively take care
of it. Expect occasional failures and bugs. However, I try my best to make the 
software efficient and reliable.

** Requirements:
Matlab (any version from 6.x)

** Installation:
Copy the library directories where-ever you want or in MALTAB/toolbox/local:
  /home/joe/Matlab/iFit
or
  /usr/local/matlab/toolbox/local/iFit
  
Then start Matlab and type in, e.g.:
>> addpath(genpath('/home/joe/Matlab/iFit'))
or
>> addpath(genpath('/usr/local/matlab/toolbox/local/iFit'))

** Quick start

A number of pages are available in the iFit/Docs directory:
