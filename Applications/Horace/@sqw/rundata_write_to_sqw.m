%
% Input:
%   dummy           Dummy sqw object  - used only to ensure that this service routine was called
%   run_file        Fully initiated by rundata information instance of @rundata class
%   sqw_file        Full file name of output sqw file
%
%   emode           Direct geometry=1, indirect geometry=2
%   u               First vector (1x3) defining scattering plane (r.l.u.)
%   v               Second vector (1x3) defining scattering plane (r.l.u.)
%   grid_size_in    Scalar or row vector of grid dimensions. Default is [1x1x1x1]
%   urange_in       Range of data grid for output. If not given, then uses smallest hypercuboid
%                  that encloses the whole data range
%
% Output:
%   grid_size       Actual grid size used (size is unity along dimensions
%                  where there is zero range of the data points)
%   urange          Actual range of grid
